# Data-Structure and Algorithm Problems Tracker

A table for keeping record of completed DSA questions. While a simple Excel document would suffice for the same purpose, this challenged me to make a website dedicated to this specific purpose.

## How to Use

While solving DSA questions, keep track of the amount of time it takes to find solution. Once completed, enter the following:

* Question (name of the problem)
* Source (e.g. LeetCode #258, CTCI #64, G4G)
* Categories (e.g. arrays, two-pointers, DFS/BFS)
* Date
* Time (minutes to solve question)

Then click the 'Enter' button and see your data inserted into the table below.

## Lessons Learned

The main focus of this project was to incorporate localStorage so each machine has its own databank to reach into when site loads. Very much enjoyed getting data to load in sequential and consistent order. Enjoyed making the site fully-responsive with the help of Chrome Dev Tools. Learned a lot about JS objects.

Learned about managing data in localStorage, and about object handling. Had to learn about deep-copies of objects so as to retain previous localStorage data when updating table. Picked up on HTML table structuring and creating dynamic tables using JS logic.

## Possible Future Updates

* New entry: Solved/Unsolved (if user attempted problem but failed to arrive at solution on their own, they select 'Unsolved).
* Change delete method from entering row number to an 'X' next to row, when hovering over row.
* Ability to edit individual items in table.
* Sorting option for getting problems by date, name, or time.
* Filtering option for getting problems of specific categories or range of time.
* Remake design of buttons and inputs into more minimalistic, sleek design.

## Deployment
